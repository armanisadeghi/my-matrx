# **Secure IT Asset Disposition (ITAD) for Orange County’s Enterprise Sector**

All Green serves as the primary disposition partner for Orange County’s most regulated industries. From the hyperscale requirements of the Irvine Spectrum technology corridor to the strict compliance demands of Newport Beach’s financial district, we provide an enterprise-grade exit strategy for retired IT assets.

We do not just remove hardware; we mitigate risk. For CIOs and IT Directors, we function as a downstream extension of your security policy, ensuring that the retirement of your infrastructure is as secure and auditable as its deployment.

## **Audit-Ready Compliance & Risk Mitigation**

In Orange County’s litigious regulatory environment, disposal is a legal event. Your internal compliance teams are already managing pressure from California’s DTSC, the CCPA/CPRA, and federal sector-specific mandates. All Green simplifies your audit defense.

We bridge the gap between your loading dock and your legal obligations. Our chain-of-custody protocols are designed to satisfy the rigorous documentation standards of:

* **California Regulatory Bodies:** Full adherence to the Electronic Waste Recycling Act (SB 20/SB 1215) and DTSC Universal Waste handling.  
* **Data Privacy Mandates:** Workflows built to satisfy CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA, GLBA, and FACTA privacy requirements.  
* **Security Standards:** Data sanitization protocols that strictly adhere to NIST SP 800-88 Guidelines for Media Sanitization.

## **Sector-Specific Disposition Strategies**

We understand that a server rack in a secure data center requires a different protocol than a pallet of returned consumer electronics. We tailor our logistics and destruction workflows to the operational realities of Orange County’s dominant industries.

### **Technology & SaaS (Irvine, Aliso Viejo, Lake Forest)**

**Supporting the High-Velocity Refresh Cycle**

For the software and semiconductor firms driving the Irvine tech corridor, asset turnover is rapid and IP protection is paramount. We understand that your decommissioned development workstations and test servers often house proprietary source code and pre-release architecture.

* **The Protocol:** We integrate with your SOC 2 or ISO 27001 compliance frameworks, providing serialized asset tracking from the moment equipment leaves your rack.  
* **The Value:** Whether you are clearing a colocation cage or refreshing an entire campus in Aliso Viejo, our Enterprise Decommissioning teams handle the physical disconnect and logistics so your SysAdmins can focus on the new deployment.

### **Healthcare & MedTech (Irvine, Mission Viejo, Anaheim)**

**Clinical-Grade Security for Connected Health**

Orange County’s hospital networks and medical device manufacturers cannot afford a "standard" recycling pickup. With the proliferation of IoT medical devices and tablets in patient care, the risk surface has expanded beyond the server room.

* **The Protocol:** All Green deploys HIPAA-trained personnel for pickups at clinical sites. We offer on-site hard drive shredding at your facility—ensuring that physical drives containing ePHI never transit public roads intact.  
* **The Value:** We provide the granular Certificates of Destruction required by HHS audits, protecting your institution from the reputational and financial damage of a data breach.

### **Financial Services (Newport Beach, Costa Mesa)**

**GLBA & SEC Compliant Destruction**

For the wealth management firms, insurers, and regional banks concentrated in Newport Center and Costa Mesa, client trust is the only asset that matters. The disposal of trading desks and client-data servers requires absolute finality.

* **The Protocol:** We execute verifiable data destruction aligned with GLBA and SEC record retention rules. Our "Audit Portal" allows your compliance officers to instantly retrieve destruction certificates by serial number years after the fact.  
* **The Value:** You receive a defensible audit trail that proves you executed due diligence, satisfying both internal risk committees and external regulators.

### **Aerospace & Defense (Huntington Beach, Fullerton)**

**DFARS & ITAR Secure Processing**

The aerospace industrial base in Huntington Beach and Anaheim operates under a different set of rules. When handling CUI (Controlled Unclassified Information) or ITAR-restricted hardware, standard wiping often isn't enough.

* **The Protocol:** We provide physical destruction workflows that meet the stringent requirements of NIST SP 800-171 and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) mandates. We offer secure, witnessed destruction for high-sensitivity assets.  
* **The Value:** We act as a compliant release valve for your secure facilities, handling engineering workstations and embedded systems with the clearance-level protocols your contracts demand.

### **Logistics & Supply Chain (Anaheim, Brea, Buena Park)**

**Maximizing Recovery on Reverse Logistics**

For the 3PLs and distribution centers anchoring the North County industrial zone, ITAD isn't just about internal laptops—it's about the flow of returned electronics.

* **The Protocol:** We partner with logistics providers to manage the "unsellable" stream. We process returned or defective electronics in compliance with California’s environmental laws, protecting you from downstream liability.  
* **The Value:** We turn a storage and disposal cost center into a revenue stream through our certified remarketing channels, returning value to your organization on assets that still have market viability.

## **Core Capabilities**

We provide a comprehensive suite of services designed to handle the entire lifecycle of your retired assets.

* **NIST 800-88 Data Sanitization:** Automated, verifiable wiping that renders data irretrievable while preserving the hardware for value recovery.  
* **On-Site Physical Shredding:** Mobile shredding units that destroy hard drives and media at your curb, allowing your security team to witness the destruction personally.  
* **Enterprise Decommissioning:** "White glove" project management for data center shut-downs and office closures. We handle the labor, packing, and heavy lifting.  
* **Certified Electronics Recycling:** R2v3 and e-Stewards guided practices ensuring zero-landfill policies and complete environmental compliance.  
* **Asset Remarketing & Value Recovery:** We test, refurbish, and resell viable assets, sharing the revenue to offset your logistics costs.

## **Serving the Greater Southern California Enterprise**

All Green’s logistics network is deeply embedded in the Southern California infrastructure. We run regular routes servicing the corporate parks of Irvine, the industrial sectors of Anaheim and Fullerton, and the coastal business districts from Newport Beach to San Clemente.

We are not just a vendor; we are the local partner that Orange County’s largest organizations trust to close the loop on their IT lifecycle.

## **Secure Your Chain of Custody**
